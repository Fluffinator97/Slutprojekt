# Nobel Popper

Nobel Popper is an arcade style type of game where the player controls the paddel with the mouse or toutchpad. You have to dodge and distory dynamite with the help of your companion Alfred Nobel. You can use the paddle to bounce the ball away to collide with the dynamite that will then explode and you will gain some extra score. If the ball reached the bottom of the screen you will die and have to start over again. Try to beat your own highscore. Also if you get hit by the dynamite you will die.
